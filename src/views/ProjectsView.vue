  I love developing tools that make me or other people more efficient
  In my free time, I continue to work on projects that bring practical solutions to pressing problems.
  My latest open-source project, "canvasdl", has received over 4,000 downloads within a month of its release.
  This Python package simplifies academic life by automating tasks like downloading materials, checking updates, and managing deadlines.
  The project's GitHub repository highlights a well-structured, readable, and tested codebase.
