        <h1>AI for the benefit of humanity</h1>

        How do you control a machine that is smarter than you in every possible
        way? The development of Artificial Intelligence is breaking all records,
        and it is only a matter of time before its capabilities will grow beyond
        our own. This revolution will decide the future of humanity, and I want
        to do everything within my power to steer it in the right direction.
        <br />
        <br />
        It is my ultimate goal to develop safe AI. By focusing on collaborative
        intelligence, I aspire to build a world where we can live in symbiosis
        with machines that are smarter than us. We have one chance to do it
        right, and we must act now!
