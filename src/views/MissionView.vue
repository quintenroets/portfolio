            As a Machine Learning enthusiast with two Master degrees in AI, I
            have been privileged to observe and participate in the ongoing AI
            revolution from a front-line perspective. My hands-on experiences
            with foundation models have strengthened my belief that the
            boundaries of AI are inexhaustible.
          </p>
          <p>
            I envision a future world transformed by AI where humanity thrives
            on a global scale. Humans are liberated to pursue their passions
            while advanced AI agents care for their health, build their houses
            and design their roads. However, this future is not without its
            challenges. The accelerating advancement and adoption of AI carries
            an incredible risk and raises ethical and control issues.
          </p>

            This is why I believe in the importance of
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_safety">AI safety</a>.
            This field of AI studies problems like machine alignment and
            mechanistic interpretability to safeguard the adoption of advanced
            AI. By prioritizing AI safety, I believe we can build a world where
            we thrive under advanced AI. We have one chance to do it right, and
            we must act now!
          </p>
